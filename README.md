# Bank Customer Churn Project

This project aims to study whether a customer will reamin a customer or close their bank account. This is also known as churn. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains 14 features. The target variable is a binary varaible that predicts whether or not a customer remains (0) or the customer closes their account (1).

With the advent of new online-only banks and bank accounts customers are quickly ditching traditional banks and moving to online-only banks so they can bank exclusively on their mobile phones, tablets, and computers and reap other benefits. The number of online-only banks is growing, and they are working to make the customer experience easier than ever. Therefore, traditional banks may be losing customers to these new banks. They will need to innovate and target customers that might be at risk of closing accounts. To remain viable, traditional banks will need to retain as many customers as possible.

This project aims to use classification and regression algorithms to determine which features most affect the incidence of customer exit from a bank. However, other techniques may be employed as needed.

Features in this dataset are as follows:

Customer ID - arbitrary customer identifier
Surname - Last name of the customer
Credit Score - Customer Credit Score
Geography - Customer locations (France, Spain, Germany)
Gender - Male/Female
Age - Customer age
Tenure - Number of years with bank
Balance - Current customer balance
Number of Products - Number of bank products per customer
Has Credit Card - Binary yes/no if customer has credit card
Is Active Member - Binary yes/no whether the customer is an active member with the bank
Estimated Salary - Customer salary estimate in USD$
Exited - Target Variable - Binary Yes/No if customer left bank
